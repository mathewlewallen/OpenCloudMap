These terms and conditions govern your use of Open Cloud Map’s services, unless you have an active executed order.

Welcome to the future of mapping! We're glad you're here.

This website, www.opencloudmap.com (the "site"), is owned and operated by Open Cloud Map, Inc. and our direct and indirect wholly‑owned subsidiaries ("Open Cloud Map", "we" or "us"). By using the site, the Services and our proprietary software and related data we make available to you via the site or a third‑party marketplace ("Marketplace"), or map content we make available to you through the Services (all the foregoing collectively, "Services"), you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service, as updated from time to time (collectively, the "Terms"). Please read them carefully. If you don’t agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services.

If you reside in Japan or if your principal place of business is in Japan, your access to and use of the Services is governed by the Japan Terms of Service.

## Signing Up

1. In order to use most Services, you must register for or authenticate into an Open Cloud Map account. To use our Services through a Marketplace, you may additionally or alternatively be required to register for or authenticate into a separate account for that Marketplace. When you use our application programming interfaces (APIs), each request to an API must include one of your account's unique API keys.
2. Please carefully guard the security of your account and monitor use of your API keys. You are responsible for all use of the Services under your account, whether authorized or not. At our discretion, we may make limited exceptions for unauthorized use if you notify us of the problem promptly.
3. You must be 18 years or older to use the Services. By registering or providing personal information on the site, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.
4. If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a company or another legal entity, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case “you” refers to that entity.

## Our Services

1. Subject to these Terms, we grant you a non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, non‑sublicensable, revocable license to:
   1. Incorporate the Services in Licensed Applications (as defined in the Product Terms).
   2. Make the Services as incorporated available to End Users (as defined in the Product Terms).

2. Your rights for non‑production use are conditional on purchasing additional licenses when required under these Terms.
3. If your Licensed Application is related to business intelligence, analytics, cloud database management, real estate, or vehicle usage, separate commercial and/or development licenses may be required.
4. Contact us if you need enterprise products or volume‑based discounts.
5. We may make beta or evaluation products available (“Evaluation Products”). Such products are for internal evaluation only and must be destroyed upon our written request.

## End Users and Notification

You may not allow End Users or third parties to use the Services in a way that would violate these Terms if done by you. You agree to take reasonable efforts to prevent such use and to promptly notify us in writing of any unauthorized use.

## Service Terms & Policies
