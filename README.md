## Freeing Aviation Data for a Brighter Futures

Welcome to the source code for **Open Cloud Map** ‚Äî a site dedicated to my lifelong passion for aviation, space, and
aerospace systems. This site isn't about me though, it's meant to grow the aviation community through lowering the costs
of entry into the industry.

## Overview

Open Cloud Map is a platform dedicated to providing free, open-source aviation data, tools, and code to the global
aviation community. We believe that access to information should not be a barrier to entry in the aviation industry. By
aggregating data from open sources and government agencies, we aim to democratize knowledge, foster innovation, and
strengthen the industry as a whole.

**Our Mission:** To lower the cost of entry into the aviation industry and empower individuals and organizations with
the knowledge they need to succeed.

**Key Features:**

* **Free Aviation Data:** Access a wide range of datasets, including airports, airspaces, NAVAIDs, NOTAMs, and other
  data usually hidden behind paywalls.
* **Open-Source Tools:** Utilize our open-source tools for data analysis, visualization, APIs, route weather, and more
  being planned.
* **Community-Driven:** Contribute to the project and help us build a better platform for everyone.

**Why Open Cloud Map?**

For too long, vital aviation data has been locked behind paywalls, limiting access and hindering innovation.
OpenCloudMap provides a free and open alternative, enabling:

* **Reduced Costs:** Eliminate expensive data subscriptions.
* **Increased Innovation:** Empower developers and researchers to build new applications and services.
* **Improved Safety:** Provide access to critical information for safer flight operations.
* **Global Collaboration:** Connect aviation professionals and enthusiasts from around the world.

## Getting Started

This section provides instructions on how to get started with Open Cloud Map, whether you want to use the data,
contribute to the code, or simply explore the platform.

### Tech

This is one of the first mapping softwares built on Nextjs, React, OpenLayers, and Supabase. The stack was chosen
because it is nearly free to use and easy to integrate. Mapping software and GIS data is hoarded by companies behind
paid APIs, but we are trying to change that. The mapping portion of this project is still under development, but we
refuse to include paid mapping services. If you contribute, then we require you to use OpenLayers, MapLibre, OpenFreMap
or other free services. This project would not be possible through paid services.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mathewlewallen/opencloudmap.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd opencloudmap
   ```
3. Add env variables
4. Install and run
   ```
   pnpm i
   pnpm dev
   ```

**Contribution Guidelines:**

* **Documentation:**  Document your code clearly.
* **Commit Messages:**  Use descriptive and informative commit messages.
* **Be respectful:**  Treat all contributors with respect.

**Areas for Contribution:**

* **Data Acquisition:**  Help us find and integrate new data sources.
* **Tool Development:**  Contribute to the development of new tools and features.
* **Documentation:**  Improve the documentation and tutorials.
* **Bug Fixes:**  Fix bugs and improve the stability of the platform.
* **Website Development:** Help improve the design and functionality of the website.
