# Running it locally

1. `pnpm install`
2.  Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` and fill in the values.
3.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.
4. `pnpm db:migrate:dev` - Creates a local SQLite database and applies migrations
5. `pnpm dev`
6.  Open http://localhost:3000

## Changes to wrangler.json

After making a change to wrangler.json, you need to run `pnpm cf-typegen` to generate the new types.

## Things to change and customize before deploying to production
1. Go to `src/constants.ts` and update it with your project details
2. Update the documentation in `./cursor-docs` with your project details so that Cursor AI can give you better suggestions
3. Update the footer in `src/components/footer.tsx` with your project details and links
4. Optional: Update the color palette in `src/app/globals.css`
5. Update the metadata in `src/app/layout.tsx` with your project details

## Deploying to Cloudflare with Github Actions

1. Create D1 and KV namespaces
2. Set either `RESEND_API_KEY` or `SENDGRID_API_KEY` as a secret in your Cloudflare Worker depending on which email service you want to use.
3. Create a Turnstile catcha in your Cloudflare account, and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` as a Github Actions variable.
4. Set `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` as a secret in your Cloudflare Worker.
5. Update the `wrangler.json` file with the new database and KV namespaces and env variables. If you change the D1 database name, you also need to update the `db:migrate:dev` script in the `package.json` file.
6. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens and click on "Use template" next to "Edit Cloudflare Workers". On the next, page add the following permissions in addition to the ones from the template:
    - Account:AI Gateway:Edit
    - Account:Workers AI:Edit
    - Account:Queues:Edit
    - Account:Vectorize:Edit
    - Account:D1:Edit
    - Account:Cloudflare Images:Edit
    - Account:Workers KV Storage:Edit
    - Zone:Cache Purge:Purge
7. Add the API token to the Github repository secrets as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
8. Add the Cloudflare account id to the Github repository variables as `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
9. Optional: If you want clear the CDN cache on deploy, add `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` to the Github repository variables for the zone id of your domain. This is the zone id of your domain, not the account id.
10. Add the database name to the Github repository variables as `DATABASE_ID`. This should match the database name in the `wrangler.json` file.
11. Push to the main branch

## Email templates
If you want to preview and edit the email templates you can:
1. `pnpm email:dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3001
